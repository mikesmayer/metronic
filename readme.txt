AngularJS Version:
Each admin theme(admin1, admin2, admin3, admin4, admin_material_design, admin2_material_design, admin3_material_design, admin4_material_design) 
comes with AngularJS versions. To learn more go to link "AngularJS Version" in the main menu.

IMPORTANT:
The frontend theme includes all the demo images/photos in the purchased theme folder just for your reference. 
For the demo purposes we used some images purchased from http://photodune.net/.
However if you like to use these photodune images(listed in "resources/frontend/corporate/photos" and "resources/frontend/ecommerce/photos" folders) then you will 
need to purchase a license for each used image. Metronic does not transfer any licenses for the images from photodune. Any image which is not listed in "resources/frontend/corporate/photos" and "resources/frontend/ecommerce/photos" folders can be used for free since they are open sources images. 

NOTE: 
To use our theme support you must be a valid customer who has the valid purchase license from ThemeForest(http://themeforest.net/item/metronic-responsive-admin-dashboard-template/4021469?ref=keenthemes)
